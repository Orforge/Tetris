# Tetris_Project
A Tetris project made for the terminal

Please read this carefully before running the attached program.

Be sure to have the files necessary for the execution of the program in the 'src' subfolders (except for the Makefile), or change their access path in the Makefile before any execution. (note that if you don't change the paths, 'exec' will be created in the 'bin' subfile, so make sure you have already created it)

If you encounter problems opening the ranking files of the best players, check their presence in the 'src' subfolder or change their path when opening them in the 'main.c' file on lines 15,24,31,38,45 and 52.

If you encounter a bug related to the ranking files (such as an 'accidental' alteration or deletion of data, etc.), do not hesitate to use the "remplis.c" program included in the Tetris pack (comments inside this program will tell you how to proceed).

If a leaderboard file has been deleted, you can recreate it using the 'touch filename' command in the terminal, then using the 'remplis.c' program as said before. (However, please be careful to give the same file name).

If you ever witness a bug, don't hesitate to report it to us while leaving us a good 20/20 :)

Have fun !
